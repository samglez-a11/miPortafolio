        <p>
            I'm a computer engineer who always love the creative world, the idea of communicate with something more than just words,
            I'm a true believer than an image can say more than thousand words. I have interest in frontend developer and desiging,
            I know I dont know everything yet but I'm so excited to keep learning new things.
